# This file is intentionally small and points to mode-specific compose files.
# Run one of the following depending on the runmode you want to start:
#
# RabbitMQ mode (app + mongo + rabbitmq):
#   docker compose -f compose/compose.rabbitmq.yaml up
#
# Kafka mode (app + mongo + kafka + kafdrop):
#   docker compose -f compose/compose.kafka.yaml up
#
# AWS/localstack mode (app + mongo + localstack + openobserve):
#   docker compose -f compose/compose.aws.yaml up

# Kept intentionally small to avoid duplication. See the mode-specific files
